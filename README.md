# Customer-Churn-Analysis---EDA
This project aims to analyze customer churn in the telecom industry through exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and contains information on customer demographics, account details, and service usage for a telecom company. 

Data:
The dataset includes 7,043 customer records with 21 variables, such as customer tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and whether the customer churned or not. The target variable is "Churn", which indicates if a customer has left the company (1) or stayed (0). 

Exploratory Data Analysis:
The key insights from the EDA include:

Churn Rates by Customer Demographics;
1.Customers aged 18-29 have the highest churn rate at 45%, while those aged 60+ have the lowest churn rate at 16%. 
2.Male customers have a slightly higher churn rate (27%) compared to female customers (24%). 

Churn Rates by Service Usage;
1.Customers with fiber optic internet service have a 42% churn rate, higher than those with DSL (23%) or no internet (10%). 
2.Customers with lower total charges (under $2,828) have an 80% churn rate, compared to 20% for those with higher total charges. 

Conclusion
Analyzing customer churn is crucial for telecom companies to retain customers and improve profitability. This EDA has provided valuable insights into the key drivers of churn, setting the stage for more advanced modeling and prediction.
